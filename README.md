# What is Snapp?

You can think of [Iranian version of Uber][snappwiki]. Their public repository is available in [here][snapprepo].

# How the Extension Works?

1. After installing the extension you need to sign in into your Snapp account.
2. When you open [https://app.snapp.taxi][snapppwa] page a script injects into the HTML `body`.
3. The script read `access-token` from the page and create a new `CustomEvent` with `access-token` and dispatched by `window`.
4. In `contentscript` we listen to the upcoming event message from the injected script. After getting the message, we save `access-token` by using [chrome.storage][chromestorage] API.
5. Every time you click on MySnapp extension's icon we read `access-token` from `chrome.storage` and then set a state in the mounted React component (popup).
6. Now we have `access-token` as a state in our component. When you click on `Let's Go` button, the App is going request to Snapp API with your `access-token`
7. After your data received from Snapp API, we use `chrome.storage` for caching. And for the next time when you click on `Let's Go` button, we show your saved data.

# Privacy Policy

**All codes executed on the client-side** and the extension is only for **personal usage**. For analyzing the data we need to get your local `access-token` from the Snapp PWA. After signing in the token will be saved in chrome storage API. You can remove the extension to destroy your `accessToken` completely.
